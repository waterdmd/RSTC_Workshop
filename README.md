# Technical Workshop: Remote Sensing for Water Resources and Water Quality Modeling Applications

Date: Sunday, May 18, 2025  
Time: 1:00 PM – 5:00 PM (Alaska Daylight Time, AKDT)  
Location: Room 4  
PDHs: 4.0 Professional Development Hours  

Organized by the Remote Sensing Applications for TMDL Modeling Task Committee (ASCE)

## Workshop Purpose

This interactive workshop introduces participants to satellite-based remote sensing tools and data products relevant to ambient water quality monitoring, watershed modeling, and TMDL applications.

Participants will:
- Gain hands-on experience using Google Earth Engine (GEE) for water resource applications.
- Learn how to access and interpret satellite imagery for climate, sediment, and water quality studies.
- Work through case studies on climate trends, suspended sediment, lake monitoring, and chlorophyll-a (CHLA) estimation.
- Engage with others working in research, policy, and practice to advance remote sensing use in water management.
