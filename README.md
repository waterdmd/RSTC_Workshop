# Tutorial for Xgboost
This repository contains jupyter notebooks to implement Extreme Gradient Boosting (Xgboost) to estimate suspended sediment concentration (SSC) using Landsat remote sensing (RS) data. These codes have been written for educational purposes.

### The repo contains two scripts:
1. Xgboost_tutorial.ipynb : Implements xgboost to real world data
2. Xgboost_illustration.ipynb : Illustrates how xgboost approximates a function

### Instructions to implement the codes
1. Download the raw data file 'dataLSTM_SR.txt' from [the link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WgRJtQNJPUq1WAwzHZe1KlrEg_WyRKPb) and save in appropriate directory
2. Downloads the notebooks in you working directory
3. Follow the instructions in jypyter notebooks
